    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am currently enrolled as a student at the Software Development Academy of Java, where I am gaining comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in Java programming, preparing myself for a career in the field. I discovered a passion for programming and decided to start my journey by completing the following courses on Udemy which taught me the fundamentals of Java and SQL. After completing them I have worked on 2 side projects were I was able to use my knowledge of what I've learn. </p>
    <p>For one of them I design a pharmacy along with objects used by it: client, drug and transaction. I implemented and covered with tests different operations like create, read, update, delete, search transactions by time period, search drugs by keywords. For the implementation I used the following technologies: SpringBoot, Spring Data, Spring Web and Hibernate.</p>
